Description:
    A Maya tool for generating Levels of Detail (LODs) for 3D models.
    This tool allows users to:
    - Clean up non-manifold geometry before reduction
    - Create multiple LODs with custom reduction percentages
    - Organize generated meshes into dedicated groups
    - Preserve skin weights when applicable (for skinned meshes)
    - Assign generated LODs to display layers for easy visibility management
